Résumé Parsing in PHP

A PHP Web Application to parse a résumé of different users!
Fill up the HTML form in `resume2txt.php` and the parser will parse the fields and 
write to a file named `Your_Name_Resume.txt`.

More functionality will be added soon!

May not run on your Linux system due to some file permission issue!!

Will fix soon!
